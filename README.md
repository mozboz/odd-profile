odd-profile
===========

Server side components for active profiles

Install these files to e.g. yourserver.com/profile/ and ensure that your server has write access to the profile.txt file

add.php is intended to be called by a remote server, not intended for viewing in the browser. Loading it in the browser will just insert an empty item in your profile.
